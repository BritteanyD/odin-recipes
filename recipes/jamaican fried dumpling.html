    <ol>
        <li>Mix flour, baking powder, and salt together in a large bowl.</li>
        <li>Rub in butter until the mixture is crumbly.</li>
        <li>Mix in water, 1 tablespoon at a time, to form a firm dough; knead briefly.</li>

        <li>Break off pieces of dough and shape them into biscuit-like patties.</li>
        <li>Place just enough of the dumplings into the hot oil so they are not
